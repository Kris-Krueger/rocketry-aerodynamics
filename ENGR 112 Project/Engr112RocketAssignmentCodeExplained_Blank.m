%% Instructions for MATLAB modelling

%In MATLAB, as mentioned in the assignment document, you will be
%computationally calculating certain parameters that will end up allowing
%you to make design decisions of your rocket fins.

%First, you will need to label all your variables with names and associate
%your given values for each. An example listing of variables are seen
%below in Section 1. Write down your variables in Section 2.

%After having all your variables in place, you will have to solve for your
%unknown variables based off of the equations described in the assignment
%document.

%The first value you will have to calculate is the Center of Pressure
%value. After knowning the Center of Pressure, you can manipulate one of
%the equations enough to find Total Surface Area of the Fins. Lastly, you
%will have to make a choice on how many fins you want on your rocket. With
%that value written down, you can find the Cross-Sectional Area of a single
%fin side with one of the last equations available to you.

%After you have a multitude of parameters (which you just solved for), you
%can start modelling your fins in SolidWorks.

%% Section 1 [Example Variables]
%Givens:
% Cg = (Center of gravity - unknown)
% SAbody = (Total Body surface area value)
% SAcone = (Total Cone surface area value)
% Dfin = (Fin distance from reference point value)
% Dbody = (Body distance from reference point value) 
% Dcone = (Cone distance from reference point value) 
% SM = (Stability margin value) 
% DiamR = (Rocket Diameter value)

%Unknowns:
% Cp = (Center of pressure value)
% Fn = (Fin number - unknown [This will be your choice])
% SAfin = (Total Fin surface area - unknown)
% CAfin = (Cross sectional area of a single fin - unknown)
